# Removed petersen/nix-setup COPR and nix-multiuser (missing deps nix-core, nix-daemon caused build failure).
# If you want Nix, the basic 'nix' package from Fedora repos is added below. Comment it out if not needed.
# For full multi-user Nix, prefer the official install script via a script module instead of COPR:
#   - type: script
#     scripts:
#       - |
#         curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh -s -- --daemon
modules:
  - type: dnf
    # No Nix package installed here because neither nix-multiuser (COPR deps missing)
    # nor a plain 'nix' package is currently available in the base Fedora repos you have access to.
    # Add other Fedora/RPM packages under packages: if needed.
    install:
      packages:
        - curl # required for fetching the Nix installer script
